UTM Capturing and Storing in Cookies
------------------------------------

This Javascript code automatically captures UTM paramters of your website visitors.
It captures multi touch interactions and storing the data in the browser cookies for 2 years
Source code: UTM-Tracking-2.0.js
Minified version: UTM-Tracking-2.0.min.js


To capture the touchpoints and extract to your form - first create a long text field and add it to the form as a hidden field.
Use the capture from cookie functionality to retrieve the value for the "__mt_attribution" cookie.
This cookie will contain all the touchpoints the visitor had during the journey, with :: as the separator between each session.
Example:
TS=153901858&R=google.com&U=ads&M=cpc&N=campaign1&T=myterm&C=campaignContent::TS=1539018587175&U=src2&M=med2&N=cmp2&T=trm2&C=cntn2::

Touchpoint metadata:
TS - timestamp
R - Referrer
S - UTM Source
M - UTM Medium
N - UTM Campaign name
T - UTM term
C - UTM content

You can leverage our marketing attribution connector to automatically parse this data and record it in your CRM or Marketing Automation platform.
