Monitor changes on my Chrome Extension page
-------------------------------------------

This google script automatically tracks the following details from your Chrome Extension page on Chrome Web Store:
* Recent Version
* Number of Users
* Rating
* Number of reviews

You can schedule it to run every few minute or on an hourly/daily basis.
Once it identifies some details changed you'll be notified by email or by a custom webhook (I used integromat to notify me by Slack).

Enjoy!
